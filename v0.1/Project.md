# Golden Project
The project should not have a hard deadline as the goal is to produce ready for work developers for the **sponsor company**
and not to produce projects for the **sponsor company** directly.

As the assignor of the project, the **board** should consider whether the project should be proprietary or open-source,
depending on the strategy of investment and|or venture partnerships.

## Project Milestone
When the project reaches or misses a milestone, the **eggvelopers** will organize a presentation for the **board**
where the situation will be discussed.

## Project Completion
Once the project is completed and after the **project milestone** presentation,
the **eggvelopers** are given a 7 day break.

During this period the **board** will provide the final assessment of the primary team of **eggvelopers**
and may reward any team member with an offer for a position in the company.

In addition the team is rewarded with the accumulated difference of *20% monthly bonuses*
that were not rewarded during the developmental phase.

Once this is completed the board should provide the primary group with a new project,
and refill the **eggveloper** ranks with members from the **twinveloper** group and the process starts over again.
