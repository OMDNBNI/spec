# Lectures

There are two categories of lectures held in the **Incubator**:
* **Runtime lectures**;
* **Planned lectures**;

## Runtime lectures

The **runtime lectures** are short stand-up lectures organized by the **anarchitect** when he/she decides that
it is needed to address an issue immediately on the spot and the whole group should be involved.

These lectures take the form of a **15-30 minute** stand-up lectures at the whiteboard, usually in the incubator
conference room, without the need to be recorded.

## Planned lectures

These lectures are the core model of conveying declarative knowledge to the group.
The lecture topics are scheduled in advance, when the necessary material is published to the group,
so that the members can prepare in advance.

The lecture topics scheduling is described in the [**dynamic curriculum**](#dynamic-curriculum),

The duration of the lectures is approximately *2 hours*, including any *5-15 minute* break if and when necessary.

During the lecture the lecturer (usually **anarchitect**) initializes the lecture topic, by giving an introductory presentation of the topic
and then mediates the group discussion on the subject in a form of a
[dialectic more than a debate](https://mapandterritory.org/debate-and-dialectic-850b3585dad4).

Two members attending the lectures are voluntarily chosen to take the role of a **digital** and **analog** monitor and
will provide assistance to the lecturer.

All **planned lectures** are recorded (both video and audio) and are distributed to the members and/or published the public.

## Dynamic Curriculum

The **dynamic curriculum** is essentially a [backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlog) of topics.
Any member of the incubator can add a topic to the curriculum, including the **anarchitect** and any **board** member.
The privilege can be extended to the public domain if the **board** deems this decision wise.

On a weekly or biweekly basis, during a weekly incubator **board** meeting,
the all the members and teams can schedule lectures from the curriculum, similarity to creating an agile sprint.
The number of lectures per week can vary, so a good starting point is to limit the number of **planned lectures**
to no more than 3 per week.

Depending on the outcome of the lecture, the lecture can be:
* **Completely resolved** - meaning that the group is satisfied with the knowledge provided
* **Partially resolved** - meaning that there were some unresolved issues during the course of the lecture
* **Rejected**

If the lecture has been completely resolved the topic is marked as **resolved** and thus is removed from the curriculum

If the lecture has been partially resolved the topic is marked as **resolved** and a new topic is placed in the curriculum
which is linked as the *"child"* topic of the original *"parent"* topic.

If the lecture has been rejected, the topic is marked as **rejected** and is placed back into the curriculum

Any **rejected** lecture is revised by the **anarchitect** modified so that it can be cleared for selection
on the next lecture planing session.

The modification may be to add|remove|change the original lecture material so that the group can prepare more adequately,
or it can be split into multiple topics, or it can be joined into another topic on the the curriculum.

## Analog monitor

The duty of an **analog monitor** is to manage the whiteboard during the lectures.
This means that the monitor can be asked to draw and write down concepts regarding the lecture context by the lecturer,
but is not limited by the lecturer.

In addition the monitor should carefully follow the flow of the lecture and keep the flow on point,
reverting it from any lengthy digression.

An ideal **analog monitor** does not need to be given directions by the lecturer.

## Digital monitor
A **digital monitor** is responsible for working on a laptop-projector hookup during the lecture.
The lecturer can ask the monitor to query a certain term or manage the power point presentation,
but is not limited by the lecturer.

In addition the monitor is responsible for fact-checking the information presented during the lecture.

An ideal **digital monitor** does not need to be given directions by the lecturer.

## Conference room
In order to facilitate these types of the lectures, the **Incubator** requires the following infrastructure:
* a conference room with
    * a whiteboard;
    * access to the internet;
* means to synchronously share internet query results (eg. a simple projector);
* means to record the lecture (eg. a simple A/V camera);
* means to distribute/publish the lecture (eg. AWS S3 + WebSite);
