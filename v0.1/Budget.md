# Budget

## Constants
* 1 month = 4 weeks (we’re talking about incubator months. Use ISO-8601 week standard.)

## Parameters
* X = Monthly budget per incubator member.
* E = Number of **eggvelopers** (n ∈ (4, 8))
* T = Number of **twinvelopers** (2n; n ∈ \[1, 4\])
* Bm = Number of members that received a monthly bonus
* Rm = Monthly Incubator reserves allocated from distributed funds.
## Expenses:
* Member budget X ∙ (E + T)
* Incubator maintenance costs
* Premises (including amortization)
* Equipment (including amortization)
* Utilities (Power, Internet, Water)
* Anarchitect's salary

## Monthly review reward
* Se = Percentage of X awarded to an eggveloper as a salary (80% by default)
* St = Percentage of X awarded to a twinveloper as a salary (60% by default)
* Sb = Percentage of X awarded to a member as a bonus (20% by default)
* Rm = X ∙ (E ∙ (100% - Se) + T ∙ (100% - St) - Bm ∙ Sb)

The monthly incubator reserves **Rm** can be spent in a variety of ways.
The board in conjunction with the anarchitect should provide
an optimal budget model for a specific purpose.

### Monthly review reward examples:
* Use the Rm to reduce the total incubator expenses (maintenance costs, anarchitect salary, ...).
* Organize events, public lectures, activities, team-building scenarios, ...
* Use it as an incentive for the **eggvelopers** to complete the project in the least time possible,
for instance the **eggvelopers** will be given the total **Rm** after project completion.
    * If a deadline is missed by the team a penalty may be put on the reward
    * ...
