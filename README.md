### A new educational model in IT

It is globally self-evident that the current state of the educational system simply does not fulfill 
the requirements of modern IT needs. 

The [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declarative_knowledge&redirect=no) 
nature of mainstream methodologies are more focused on storing a certain quantity of solutions to relevant existing problems 
into the mind of a student, who is then expected to utilize this information by applying these solutions on problems
that they encounter in the course of their perspective careers. 

As can be noticed, this methodology fails when an ex-student becomes an employee and is encountered with 
completely new sets of problems, which haven’t been covered during their *“educational”* period.
This trend is most obviously observed in the IT industry where change is the only relevant constant.

Here is a good starting point to get more information on the difference between
[Declarative vs Procedural Knowledge](http://unt.unice.fr/uoh/learn_teach_FL/affiche_theorie.php?id_concept=90)

The **OMDNBNI** methodology proposes a different approach of preparing the young people entering the job market, 
by focusing more on honing and tuning the [procedural knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge) of a student, 
focusing them on practicing problem-solving and establishing a set of appropriate skills and habits that will 
help them in the workplace on a daily basis. These skills include: 
* using a PM tool (Project Management), 
* coding in collaboration, 
* doing group presentations, 
* having meaningful meetings, 
* doing research, 
* keeping a functional working environment, 
* teamwork and others.
 
The goal of the process is to create an autodidact who is capable of acquiring the necessary declarative knowledge 
expeditiously and has gone through the “adaptation” period establishing positive working habits in a separate environment, 
minimizing the risks to production projects.

In order for us to reach this ambitious goal, the method is based around the concept of creating 
a *“sandbox”* environment where the students can actively participate in a role-playing simulation of a startup company. 

During the time in the simulation, they will be presented with lectures, based on a **dynamic curriculum** that 
behaves as a *[backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlog)*. 

The enrollment of students in the **Incubator** and their graduation is monitored and managed by the incubator **Board**. 

The members of the **Board** can offer a position in their company to an **OMDNBNI** graduate or make other suitable arrangements.

## Current Version

This project is a work in progress and is being maintained by the community members.

The current version of the project is **[OMDNBNI v0.1](v0.1/toc.md)** where the paradigm is described in detail.
It will be revised after the method had been tested in real-life.

## Roadmap

The specification will be released as soon as the first Incubator instance is setup and running.
At that point the specification will be released under version **v1.0**, which we hope to achieve by November 2017
